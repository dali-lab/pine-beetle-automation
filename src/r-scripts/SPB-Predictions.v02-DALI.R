# Carissa's script to make predictions based on hard-coded coefficients,
# requiring these variables as input:
#	SPB: SPB per trap per two weeks during spring trapping (year t)
#	cleridst1: clerids per trap per two weeks during spring trapping last year (t-1)
#	spotst1: beetle spots in forest last year (t-1)
#	spotst2: beetle spots in forest two years ago (t-2)
#	endobrev: 0 or 1 for endobrevicomin absent or present in SPB traps
# originally the above were also hard-coded with SPB = 2635, cleridst1 = 582, spotst1 = 1056, spotst2 = 471, endobrev = 1
#
# Revised by Jeff Liu, DALI 20F, to accept tabular instead of single-row data
# Revised by Jeff Liu, Angela Zhang, DALI 20F to fix bug in dividing SPB by 10 when endobrev == 1


attach(input[[1]]) # takes single parameter, called as R.data({ data: [{ SPB, cleridst1, spotst1, spotst2, endobrev }] }) from node.js
# this script DOES NOT check 'data' for validity; the caller is responsible.
